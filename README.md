## Basic LaTeX Functions for Jupyter Notebook:
# Example of LaTeX in Jupyter Notebook

## 1. Mathematical Expression

The quadratic formula is given by:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

## 2. Summation

The summation from 1 to n is written as:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$

## 3. Integral

The area under the curve can be represented by the integral:

$$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)$$

## 4. Fractions

Hereâ€™s how you can write fractions:

$$\frac{a}{b}$$

## 5. Exponents and Logarithms

Exponential and logarithmic functions:

$$e^{x} \quad \text{and} \quad \log(x)$$

## 6. Trigonometric Functions

The sine, cosine, and tangent functions:

$$\sin(\theta), \cos(\theta), \tan(\theta)$$

## 7. Limits

The limit of a function as it approaches infinity:

$$\lim_{{x \to \infty}} \frac{1}{x} = 0$$

## 8. Matrix

A 2x2 matrix can be represented as:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{pmatrix}
$$

# Subscript Example in LaTeX

## 1. Single Character Subscript

The chemical formula for water is:

$$H_2O$$

## 2. Multiple Characters in Subscript

To represent variables with multiple characters in subscripts, use curly braces:

$$x_{sub} + y_{sub}$$

## 3. Subscript in Summation

The summation of i from 1 to n is:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i$$

## 4. Subscript with Exponent

Combining subscripts and exponents:

$$x_i^2$$
