## Basic LaTeX Functions for Jupyter Notebook:
# Example of LaTeX in Jupyter Notebook

## 1. Mathematical Expression

The quadratic formula is given by:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

## 2. Summation

The summation from 1 to n is written as:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$

## 3. Integral

The area under the curve can be represented by the integral:

$$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)$$

## 4. Fractions

Hereâ€™s how you can write fractions:

$$\frac{a}{b}$$

## 5. Exponents and Logarithms

Exponential and logarithmic functions:

$$e^{x} \quad \text{and} \quad \log(x)$$

## 6. Trigonometric Functions

The sine, cosine, and tangent functions:

$$\sin(\theta), \cos(\theta), \tan(\theta)$$

## 7. Limits

The limit of a function as it approaches infinity:

$$\lim_{{x \to \infty}} \frac{1}{x} = 0$$

## 8. Matrix

A 2x2 matrix can be represented as:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{pmatrix}
$$

# Subscript Example in LaTeX

## 1. Single Character Subscript

The chemical formula for water is:

$$H_2O$$

## 2. Multiple Characters in Subscript

To represent variables with multiple characters in subscripts, use curly braces:

$$x_{sub} + y_{sub}$$

## 3. Subscript in Summation

The summation of i from 1 to n is:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i$$

## 4. Subscript with Exponent

Combining subscripts and exponents:

$$x_i^2$$



# Displaying Curly Braces in LaTeX

## 1. Curly braces as text:

To show curly braces in LaTeX, use:

$$ \{ \text{This is a set of curly braces} \} $$

## 2. Display curly braces in text format:

\{ This is another way to display curly braces in a sentence \}

## Epsilon 
$$ \epsilon $$

# Derivatives in LaTeX

## 1. First-Order Derivative

The first-order derivative of a function \( f \) with respect to \( x \):

$$ \frac{d f}{d x} $$

## 2. Second-Order Derivative

The second-order derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( x \):

$$ \frac{d^2 f}{d x^2} $$

## 3. Higher-Order Derivative (n-th order)

The n-th order derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( x \):

$$ \frac{d^n f}{d x^n} $$

## 4. Derivative with respect to multiple variables

For example, the derivative of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \):

$$ \frac{d f}{d x}, \quad \frac{d f}{d y} $$

## 5. Total Derivative

The total derivative of a function \( f \) with respect to \( x \):

$$ \frac{d}{d x} f(x, y(x)) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \frac{d y}{d x} $$

## 6. Gradient as a Derivative

The gradient of a scalar function \( f \):

$$ \nabla f = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \right) $$

## 7. Chain Rule

The chain rule for a composite function \( f(g(x)) \):

$$ \frac{d}{d x} f(g(x)) = \frac{d f}{d g} \cdot \frac{d g}{d x} $$

## 8. Implicit Differentiation

For a function defined implicitly by an equation \( f(x, y) = 0 \), the implicit derivative is:

$$ \frac{d y}{d x} = -\frac{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}}{\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}} $$


## Partial derivatives
# Partial Derivatives in LaTeX

## 1. First-order Partial Derivative

The first-order partial derivative of a function \( f \) with respect to \( x \):

$$ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} $$

## 2. Second-order Partial Derivative

The second-order partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( x \):

$$ \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} $$

## 3. Mixed Partial Derivatives

For mixed partial derivatives, like with respect to \( x \) and \( y \):

$$ \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} $$

## 4. Gradient (Vector of Partial Derivatives)

The gradient of a function \( f(x, y) \) is represented as:

$$ \nabla f = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \right) $$

## 5. Laplacian (Sum of Second-Order Partial Derivatives)

The Laplacian of \( f(x, y) \) is:

$$ \nabla^2 f = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} $$
